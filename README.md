## 📥 Installation

You can install this integration using one of two methods:

### Method 1: Direct Google Sheets Setup (Recommended for Non-Developers)

1. **Create a New Google Sheet**
   - Go to [Google Sheets](https://sheets.google.com)
   - Create a new blank spreadsheet

2. **Install the Script**
   - Go to `Extensions > Apps Script`
   - Delete any default code in the editor
   - Copy and paste the code from `src/main.gs` into the editor
   - Save the project (give it a name like "Iterable Integration")
   - Close the Apps Script editor

### Method 2: Using CLASP (Recommended for Developers)

1. **Install CLASP**
   - Follow the [official Google CLASP documentation](https://developers.google.com/apps-script/guides/clasp)
   - Install Node.js (version 4.7.4 or later)
   ```bash
   npm install -g @google/clasp
   clasp login
   ```

2. **Clone this Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/iterable-google-sheets-integration.git
   cd iterable-google-sheets-integration
   ```

3. **Create a New Google Sheet**
   - Go to [Google Sheets](https://sheets.google.com)
   - Create a new blank spreadsheet
   - Copy the spreadsheet ID from the URL (the long string between /d/ and /edit)

4. **Create and Link the Apps Script Project**
   ```bash
   clasp create --type sheets --title "Iterable Integration" --parentId "YOUR_SPREADSHEET_ID"
   clasp push
   ```

5. **Enable the Apps Script API**
   - Visit [Google Apps Script API](https://script.google.com/home/usersettings)
   - Enable the Google Apps Script API

6. **Deploy the Script**
   ```bash
   clasp deploy
   ```

### Post-Installation Setup (Required for Both Methods)

1. **Configure Iterable API Key**
   - Return to your Google Sheet
   - Click `Iterable > Configure API Key`
   - Paste your Iterable API key when prompted

2. **Select Data Center**
   - Click `Iterable > Select Data Center`
   - Choose your Iterable data center (US or EU) - US is the default if not specified
   - If you're unsure, leave as US

3. **Set Catalog Name**
   - Click `Iterable > Set Catalog to populate`
   - Enter your catalog name
   - Note: The catalog must exist in Iterable. If it doesn't:
     1. Log into your Iterable account
     2. Navigate to Content > Catalogs
     3. Click "Create Catalog"
     4. Enter the same name you plan to use in the integration
     5. Save the catalog (it can be empty)

4. **Initialize Sheets**
   - Click `Iterable > Sheet Setup`
   - This will create the required sheets with proper configuration

> **Note for Developers**: When using CLASP, you can make local changes and push them to the sheet using `clasp push`. Use `clasp pull` to get the latest version from Google Sheets.

## 🧪 Sheet Configuration

### campaignContent Sheet
- Contains your actual data
- First column must be named "key" (automatically created)
- Add additional columns as needed for your data

### config-campaignContent Sheet
- Contains field configuration that defines how your data will be structured in Iterable
- Three columns: Field, DataType, Source
- DataType column has a dropdown with options:
  - string
  - date
  - double
  - long
  - boolean
  - object

#### Adding New Fields
1. **Add Field Configuration**
   - Add a new row in the config-campaignContent sheet
   - In the "Field" column, enter the exact name of your field (case-sensitive)
   - Select the appropriate data type from the dropdown in the "DataType" column
   - (Optional) If the field requires data from another sheet, specify the source in the "Source" column

2. **Update campaignContent Sheet**
   - Add a new column in the campaignContent sheet
   - Use the exact same field name as specified in config-campaignContent
   - Ensure the data you enter matches the specified data type

3. **Catalog Updates**
   - When you run "Upload Content to Iterable", the script will:
     - First update your Iterable catalog with the new field definitions
     - Then upload your data with the new fields
   - The catalog in Iterable will automatically reflect any new fields you add
   - Existing fields cannot be deleted from the catalog once created

Example configuration:
| Field     | DataType | Source |
|-----------|----------|--------|
| productId | string   |        |
| price     | double   |        |
| inStock   | boolean  |        |
| createdAt | date     |        |
| variants  | object   |        |

> **Important**: Field names in both sheets must match exactly. The script will validate this before uploading to Iterable.

> **Note**: Once a field is added to the catalog in Iterable, it cannot be removed. You can only add new fields or modify existing ones.

## 📤 Using the Script to upload content

1. **Prepare Your Data**
   - Add your data to the `campaignContent` sheet
   - Ensure the first column contains unique keys
   - Fill in other columns according to your configuration

2. **Validate Your Configuration**
   - Before uploading, verify that all fields in campaignContent are properly defined:
     1. Open the campaignContent sheet and note all column headers (except "key")
     2. Open the config-campaignContent sheet
     3. Check that each column header from campaignContent exists in the "Field" column of config-campaignContent
     4. Verify that the data type for each field is correctly set
     5. If any fields are missing, add them to config-campaignContent following the instructions in the "Adding New Fields" section
   - The script will check this validation before uploading, but it's best to verify manually first

3. **Upload to Iterable**
   - Click `Iterable > Upload Content to Iterable`
   - The script will:
     1. Validate that all fields are properly configured
     2. Update the Iterable catalog with any new fields
     3. Upload your data to Iterable
   - Check the execution log for any errors or success messages

> **Tip**: If you get an error about missing field definitions, check the config-campaignContent sheet and make sure all your campaignContent columns are properly defined there.
